# Assignment 3 notes
- For dialogue, approach the enemy and press E to interact.
- Unfortunately due to bugs from my original project, I had forked the lecture repository, and couldn't find the time to reimplement a lot of functionality.  However, there are death states that trigger win/death screens.
- The enemy will follow the spline path/loiter to a random position if decorator inverse (cannot see player), but when sees player will move to player and do attack task (hold gun anim + shoot a projectile)
